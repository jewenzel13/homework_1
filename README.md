  Gif of Control Interface in Operation:

  Issues with Current Design:
  •	The buttons are not in a single column, but more in a grid layout
  •	For the middle column buttons, it is unclear if the button to that floor is on the left hand side or right hand side
  •	The layout of the buttons can be confusing
  •	There is no 1st floor label

TO GET A B

  Common Uses:
  •	Going to a desired floor that could take longer and harder to get to versus taking the stairs
  •	Transporting heavy loads to desired floor
  •	Taking handicapped people to their desired floor

  Effective Interface:
  •	The interface does make the common uses for the elevator easier for those who use it

  User Interaction
  •	There are buttons on the control panel that the user can push that performs different actions

  Common Sequence of Events:
  •	The user presses the direction button outside of the elevator to summon the elevator to the user’s current floor and indicate to the elevator which direction the user wants to go
  •	The user waits for the elevator to reach their current floor and open the doors
  •	The user enters the elevator and presses the button to the floor the user wants to go
  •	The doors will close automatically after the user select’s their floor, but the user can close the doors sooner of keep them open longer if they press either of the door buttons that show an image of opening or closing
  •	The user waits for the elevator to reach their desired floor and for the doors to open
  •	The user exits the elevator

  Elevator Support:
  •	To have the user summon the elevator, there are only 2 buttons on the outside panel
  •	To go to any floor there is a button next to the floor number indicating which button goes to which floor
  •	To open or close the door manually there is a button next to the image indicating which button opens or closes the door manually
  •	To sound the alarm or call the front desk for help there is a button next to the image indicating which button sound the alarm and calls for help
  •	If the user is blind, there are Braille characters indicating what action that button does

  Feedback:
  •	Only the floor buttons light up when selected
  •	The elevator makes a "ding" sound when it has reached the user's floor
  •	The alarm button produces an "alarm" sound
  •	The elevator doors open or close when holding the related door button
  •	The elevator displays the current floor number

  Common Mistakes:
  •	Accidentally pushing the wrong direction button when calling the elevator and not correcting it
  •	Accidentally pressing the wrong floor button and not correcting it
  •	Trying to clear the input by pressing the button with the "X" image

  Improvements:
  •	Replace individual floor buttons with a numeric keypad
  •	User can clear and enter their desired floor
  •	Every button lights up when pressed
  •	The elevator produces voice indication based on the action the user performed on the control panel
